# Jupyter Starter Kit

Welcome to the Jupyter Notebooks/Lab Starter Kit repository! This collection of
Jupyter Notebook files is designed to introduce new users to the world of 
Jupyter, a powerful tool for interactive computing, data analysis, and 
visualization.

## What is Jupyter? 

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows 
you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, 
visualizations, and narrative text. It supports various programming languages, 
including Python, R, Julia, and more.

## Getting Started

Jupyter should already be installed on the Virtual Machine (VM) you have logged 
on. To launch it double click either of the 2 following shortcuts

- [jupyter-lab.lnk](./jupyter-lab.lnk)
- [jupyter-notebook.lnk](./jupyter-notebook.lnk)

> 📝 More on the distinction between Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook later on. 

This will open a new browser window or tab with the Jupyter interface. Once the 
Jupyter interface is open, you can explore the various Jupyter Notebook files 
included in this repository. Each notebook provides an introduction to 
different aspects of Jupyter, including:

- [What is the Jupyter Notebook.ipynb](./notebooks/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb)
- [Notebook Basics.ipynb](./notebooks/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb)
- [Running Code.ipynb](./notebooks/Running%20Code.ipynb)
- [Working With Markdown Cells.ipynb](./notebooks/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.ipynb)
- [Typesetting Equations.ipynb](./notebooks/Typesetting%20Equations.ipynb)
- [Custom Keyboard Shortcuts.ipynb](./notebooks/Custom%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts.ipynb)

Feel free to experiment with the code in the notebooks, modify them, or create 
your own. Jupyter is all about interactive computing, so don't hesitate to 
explore and learn by doing.

For more information on Jupyter and its capabilities, check out the official 
Jupyter [documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/).

## Visual Python extension

Your Jupyter set up comes with the Visual Python package. It is a GUI-based 
Python code generator for data science. Read the documentation 
[here] https://visual-python.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/welcome-to-visual-python

> 💡 Skip the installation steps. this is already taken care of. 

## Jupyter Notebook vs Jupyter Lab

In summary, Jupyter Notebook offers a simpler interface for basic interactive
computing, while Jupyter Lab provides a more versatile environment with 
additional features and modularity.

### Jupyter Notebook:

- **User Interface**: Web-based environment for creating and sharing documents 
  containing live code, equations, visualizations, and text.
- **Cells**: Composition of code, Markdown, or raw text cells, allowing for 
  independent execution.
- **Extensions**: Basic functionality with the option to extend via additional 
  extensions.

### Jupyter Lab:

- **User Interface**: Next-generation web-based interface offering a flexible 
  and powerful environment.
- **Modularity**: Extensible environment with support for arranging multiple 
  documents and activities side by side.
- **IDE Features**: Includes features akin to integrated development 
  environments (IDEs) like syntax highlighting and debugging tools.
- **File Browser**: Enhanced file browser for efficient file management.
- **Interactive Widgets**: Supports interactive widgets for creating rich user
  interfaces within notebooks.
